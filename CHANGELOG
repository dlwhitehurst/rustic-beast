#CHANGELOG

October 12, 2021

Commits today reflect the state of an unoperational Tavros on
bare-metal K8s version 1.21.0. Tavros sets up DNS internally 
and actually stops in an Ansible role and waits for you to prepare
DNS records with your provider before proceeding. 

I only have a single public IP but my solution so far is 
port-forwarding to two load-balanced IPs on my 192.168.1.x network.
This has been troublesome but it's also why my fork is a branch
bare-metal-1.21.0.

The Ansible playbook is currently commented as I've been trying to 
do one role at a time. There are dependencies between roles and a 
spreadsheet matrix of these dependencies would be very nice. 

I'll schedule some time with Randy and maybe we can work out how to
efficiently do this.
